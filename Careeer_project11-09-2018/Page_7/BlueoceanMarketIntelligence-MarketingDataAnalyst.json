Integrating these different (and at times unstructured) data sources with traditional primary research data (e.g. survey-based data, focus groups, etc.) is becoming critical in driving a data driven culture into Intel's marketing efforts, including driving more effective media targeting and spending; and the build out of predictive models designed to increase the sales efficiency of our marketing campaigns.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Responsibilities:</strong>\n<br><br>\nThe Marketing Data Analyst position requires in-depth data analytics knowledge and expertise.
