For a complete description of our benefits for this position, please visit our website, click here.\n<br><br>\nAs a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.\n<br><br>\nUW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a Great College to Work For for four consecutive years.\n<br><br>\nEvery day UW Bioengineering invents the future of medicine. We bridge the traditional disciplines of medicine and engineering to drive health care forward for those in remote parts of the world and here at home. Students, scientists, engineers, and physicians come together here to develop innovative and cost-effective approaches to improve health care.\n<br><br>\nUW Bioengineering naturally evolved from partnerships between engineering and medicine. Today, our faculty and students continually reach across traditional boundaries in education and research. The interdisciplinary scope of our research spans five overarching themes: regenerative medicine and biomaterials, molecular and cellular engineering, imaging and image-guided therapy, technology to improve access to health care, and systems and synthetic biology.\n<br><br>\nUW Bioengineering currently has an outstanding opportunity for a <strong>RESEARCH DATA ANALYST</strong>.\n<br><br>\nThe Sanders Lab is a 15-person interdisciplinary group of bioengineers, clinicians, mechanical and electrical engineers and software specialists. The research is focused on development and implementation of novel measurement techniques for external prosthetics. The goal of the projects is to create instruments to help practitioners better understand patient prosthetic fit problems and select treatments to improve function and quality of life.\n<br><br>\nThis position relies on strong laboratory bench work, critical thinking and analysis aptitude and the capability to work well with a team of other engineers and practitioners.
