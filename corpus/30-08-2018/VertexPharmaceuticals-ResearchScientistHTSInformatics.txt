{"job title": "Research Scientist HTS Informatics", "company": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals", "city": "Boston", "state": "MA", "rating": "3.6", "job description": "Job Description:<br><br>We are seeking a creative scientist to join the Modeling &amp; Informatics (M&amp; I) group at Vertex, to work in the area of high throughput screening (HTS) data analytics, visualization and decision support. We are specifically looking for a candidate with a strong background in cheminformatics, coupled with solid data science experience. This position will be part of our global M&amp;I function, which resides at the interface between Research and Development and plays a key role in our continuing efforts to find novel, innovative treatments for serious human diseases. The ideal candidate will be responsible for analysis of HTS datasets to support all aspects of screening campaigns across the organization, including ensuring data quality, hit selection and prioritization and integration of historical and external data sources to enable better HTS decision making. The candidate will be responsible for developing best practice guidelines for HTS analysis. It is expected that the candidate will implement and benchmark published approaches to HTS analysis when they fit our needs, and perform research to develop novel methods to enhance our current capabilities.\n<br><br>\nThese activities will be performed in collaboration with screening scientists to support projects and global solutions. Strong collaboration and communication skills are therefore essential.\n<br><br>\n#LI-BS1<br><br>Qualification:\n<ul>\n<li>PhD or PhD equivalent in a computational field (e.g., cheminformatics, computational chemistry or biology, computer science) with a background in chemistry or else a PhD or equivalent in chemistry or biochemistry with a computational emphasis is required.</li><li>A solid understanding of statistics and expertise in R or other programming language (e.g. Python) is essential. Experience with cheminformatics toolkits (e.g., OpenEye, RDKit) and packages (e.g., Schrodinger, MOE, KNIME) is expected.</li><li>Specific expertise in building predictive models using statistical &amp; machine-learning methods is a must.</li> <li>The ideal candidate should have evidence of creative approaches to HTS analytics via publications, presentations or software. Individuals with excellent communication skills and the ability to work both independently and collaboratively across our global research organization will be given preference.</li><li>Additional experience in these areas would be an asset:</li><li>Prior experience in visualizing scientific datasets, especially ones where multiple dimensions and data types are integrated and/or experience with pathway analysis and related bioinformatics methods is preferred. Prior experience in chemical biology (either from a data analysis or experimental perspective) is desirable.</li>\n</ul>"}
