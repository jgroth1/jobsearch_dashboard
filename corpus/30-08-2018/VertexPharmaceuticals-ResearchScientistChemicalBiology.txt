{"job title": "Research Scientist Chemical Biology", "company": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals", "city": "Boston", "state": "MA", "rating": "3.6", "job description": "Job Description:<br><br>We seek a cell and molecular biologist to join the Chemical Biology group in the Boston Research organization. We are looking for a motivated and talented individual to help in our efforts to discover transformative new therapies for patients. This position will work in project teams at the intersection of chemistry, biology, and genetics to identify and validate new targets for the treatment of genetic diseases. The role of the candidate will be to plan and carry out experiments designed to identify and validate the targets of small molecules in cells and to understand the role of new targets in disease contexts. This work will include general biochemical and cellular experiments, genetic manipulation of cell lines, design and use of plasmids for stable and transient transfection, live cell imaging, and cellular assay development as well as interpretation of proteomic, genomic, and transcriptomic data.\n<br>\nThe ideal candidate will have a background in chemical biology or pathway biology with a strong track record of interdisciplinary research.
