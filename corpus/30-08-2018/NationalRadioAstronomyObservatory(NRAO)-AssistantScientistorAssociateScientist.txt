{"job title": "Assistant Scientist or Associate Scientist", "company": "National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)", "city": "Socorro, NM, United St", "state": "es", "rating": "3.3", "job description": "<div><div>Position Description:\n<br><br>\nPosition Summary\n<br><br>\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory\u2019s (NRAO) mission is to enable forefront research into the Universe at radio wavelengths. In partnership with the scientific community, we:\n<ul>\n<li>Provide world leading telescopes, instrumentation and expertise,</li><li>Train the next generation of scientists and engineers, and</li><li>Promote astronomy to foster a more scientifically literate society.</li>\n</ul>\nThe NRAO is recruiting two scientific staff positions to be located in Socorro, NM, the home of the Domenici Science Operations Center, which houses the scientific, engineering, technical, computer and support staff for both the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The Science Operations Center also houses the control center and correlator for VLBA observations and hosts personnel working on the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) project. The VLBA is entering a period of financial stability offered by a new partnership arrangement. Over the next several years, new development and user support projects will be launched which will improve the capabilities of the VLBA.\n<br><br>\nThe staff scientists recruited for these positions are expected to facilitate cutting-edge science done by community members and work to enhance the observing capabilities for the VLBA. The ideal candidates will contribute to the overall NRAO mission and must be able to demonstrate success working within a collaborative environment that promotes motivation, leadership and team building.\n<br><br>\nNRAO staff scientists are expected to carry out an independently directed research program using 25% of their time. Active and engaged research is important because staff scientists are expected to push the telescopes\u2019 capabilities, building on their own research and the needs of the broader astronomical community. Finally, staff scientists are also expected to be versatile and flexible in their science and functional work to adapt to new challenges and opportunities as NRAO and the astronomical landscape evolve. Candidates should discuss their skills and adaptability in their cover letter. Current DSOC staff scientists are working on a wide range of scientific topics, from planetary science to stars to external galaxies to cosmology, including time-variable phenomena. The staff scientist recruited for this position will become a part of that range of scientific research, in these or other areas. Opportunities for advising students and postdocs are available both through internal and external support.\n<br><br>\nNRAO staff scientists are also expected to support the Observatory and community through functional duties. For this position, such duties might include working in areas like:\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancing the observing capabilities of the VLBA;</li><li>Support of VLBA users in all areas;</li><li>Support global VLBI efforts, including the High Sensitivity Array, the Global VLBI Millimeter Array;</li><li>VLBA scientific interfacing to software programs such as CASA, the NRAO Data Archive, and Science Ready Data Products;</li><li>Support development of long baseline aspects of Next Generation VLA (ngVLA).</li>\n</ul>\nor other areas, as dictated by the needs of the observatory and the skills and interests of the successful applicant.\n<br><br>\nSocorro is a small, historical town in the Rio Grande Valley, 75 miles south of Albuquerque. In addition to competitive pay, NRAO provides excellent paid time off benefits (vacation and sick leave). Medical, dental and vision plans are effective first day of employment. NRAO\u2019s retirement benefit contributes an amount equal to 10 percent of a qualified participant\u2019s base pay. No contribution is required of the employee; we also offer an optional supplemental, tax-deferred plan for employee retirement contributions.\n<br><br>\nJob Duties Summary\n<br><br>\nThe positions entail 25% independent research and 75% functional responsibilities. The research may be multi-wavelength in nature but should be synergistic with NRAO facilities and the general broad mission of the NRAO. However, applicants with a scientific interest in VLBI will have an advantage. For functional work, the staff scientist will be a member of the VLA/VLBA Scientific User Support Division, within the New Mexico Operations Department, working under the direction of the Long Baseline Observatory (LBO) Director. The focus of the functional responsibilities will comprise a combination of supporting the VLBA user community in delivering science from the telescope, supporting the proper functioning of the VLBA as a system, including antennas, software, and correlator, and in developing new observing capabilities and observing modes for the VLBA. The initial appointment will be made at the level of Assistant Scientist. In exceptional cases, a higher rank will be considered.\n<br><br>\nAppointments will be in residence in Socorro, New Mexico.\n<br><br>\nPosition Requirements:\n<br><br>\nMinimum Education\n<br><br>\nPhD in astronomy, astrophysics or related field.\n<br><br>\nMinimum Experience\n<br><br>\nThree years of postdoctoral experience in radio interferometry or equivalent experience.\n<br><br>\nPreferred Experience\n<br><br>\nExperience with observatory science operations\n<br><br>\nKnowledge of VLBI techniques\n<br><br>\nCompetency Summary\n<ul>\n<li>Evidence of ability to function in an observatory setting</li><li>Established record of independent research</li><li>Familiarity with scientific computing/research software</li><li>Flexibility and adaptability to a changing work environment</li><li>Strong interpersonal skills/team work/proficiency in communication (verbal and written)</li><li>Demonstrated interest in broadening participation</li>\n</ul>\nOther Considerations<br><br></div></div>"}
