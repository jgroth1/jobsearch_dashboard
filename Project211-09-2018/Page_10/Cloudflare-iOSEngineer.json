Today, Cloudflare runs one of the world's largest distributed networks that powers more than 10 trillion requests per month, which is nearly 10 percent of all Internet requests worldwide. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code.\n<br><br>\nOur customers range from Fortune 500 companies and nonprofits to small businesses and budding entrepreneurs. We are working to create a faster, more secure, and more reliable experience for anyone online and given the scale at which we operate, our mission is big. Our team is hard at work shaping the future of the Internet by solving some of its toughest challenges. Come join us!<br><br><strong>About the Department</strong><br><br>Product Strategy is where new, bold, products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a massively successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers. Cloudflare's edge and network make it possible to solve problems at massive scale and efficiency which would be impossible for almost any other organization.\n<br><br>\nAt any given moment Product Strategy is engaged in a half dozen projects, each driven by a small technical team of just a handful of developers. These teams are empowered to drive the product and technical vision to build things which are, in the words of our CTO, 'audacious'. Unlike an R&amp;D division, Product Strategy doesn't build theoretical or abstract tools, we brought six products to market in the first quarter of this year alone.\n<br><br>\n<strong>What you'll do</strong>\n<br><br>\nThe product you will work on will fundamentally change how people interact with the internet.

You have a passion for growing yourself and your teammates and always have your sights set on getting better.

We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Project Galileo</strong>: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Project Athenian</strong>: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Path Forward Partnership</strong>: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.\n<br><br>\n<strong>1.1.1.1</strong>: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy policy and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\n<br><br>\nSound like something you'd like to be a part of? We'd love to hear from you!\n<br><br>\n<em>Cloudflare hires the best people based on an evaluation of their abilities and effectiveness.
