Our growth has come from innovative, bold approaches to solving some of the world\u2019s most challenging communication technology problems.\n<br><br>\nMaxLinear began by developing the World\u2019s first high-performance TV tuner chip using standard CMOS process technology. Others said we couldn\u2019t achieve the extremely high performance requirements using CMOS, but we proved them wrong and achieved enduring global market leadership with our designs. Since then, we\u2019ve developed a full line of products for satellite communications, cable modems, and terrestrial TV; diversified into high speed products addressing Datacom applications such as 400 Gbps fiber-optic interconnect chips for high-speed networks; and MoCA technology for home networking.\n<br><br>\nOur headquarters is in Carlsbad, near San Diego, California. We also have major design centers in Irvine and San Jose, CA; in Vancouver, Canada; in Herzliya, Israel; in Valencia, Spain; and in Bangalore, India.\n<br><br>\nWe have approximately 800 employees, a substantial majority of whom have engineering degrees, and include masters and Ph.D. graduates from many of the premiere universities around the world. Our engineers thrive on innovation, outstanding execution, outside-the-box thinking, nimbleness, and collaboration.
