{"job title": "Web Services Engineer - Microservices", "company": "Cloudflare", "city state": "\u2013 Austin, TX", "rating": "4.0", "job description": "<strong>About Us</strong><br><br>At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today, Cloudflare runs one of the world's largest distributed networks that powers more than 10 trillion requests per month, which is nearly 10 percent of all Internet requests worldwide. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code.\n<br><br>\nOur customers range from Fortune 500 companies and nonprofits to small businesses and budding entrepreneurs. We are working to create a faster, more secure, and more reliable experience for anyone online and given the scale at which we operate, our mission is big. Our team is hard at work shaping the future of the Internet by solving some of its toughest challenges. Come join us!<br><br><strong>About the Department</strong><br><br>Cloudflare's Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles about 10% of HTTP requests on the Internet today. We also build and run the internal tools that builds and runs our software. The Engineering Team is split into two groups: one handles product development and the other handles operations. Product development covers both new features and functionality and scaling our existing software to meet the challenges of a massively growing customer base. The operations team handles one of the world's largest networks with data centers in 102 cities worldwide.\n<br><br>\n<strong>About the Role</strong>\n<br><br>\nBack in 2014, Cloudflare launched Universal SSL to provide all of our customers with the security of encrypted traffic between visitors and Cloudflare's network. On the day we flipped the switch, we doubled the amount of sites using SSL/TLS on the internet. Since then, we've been working on providing even more ways to encrypt traffic easier and more effectively. To better serve our customers, we're constantly improving our systems for issuing, managing, and deploying TLS certificates. By joining Cloudflare's Security Engineering team, you can help ensure that every site owner has the ability to provide their users with a secure connection.\n<br><br>\nYour code will help ensure millions of websites have access to encryption. As such, the results of your code will be felt by millions of site owners and billions of visitors every day. We're continuously providing technology to site owners that was previously only available to the largest organizations. Your contributions will help make the web a faster, safer, better, and more heavily encrypted place.\n<br><br>\n<strong>What you'll do</strong>\n<br><br>\nCloudflare is looking for a Web Services Engineer to help us build services (small or micro) with RESTful APIs and their own datastores using Python and Go. You will also write/update a spec for your service, so others know how it works. In this role you will integrate multiple services via message queue-like (Kafka) systems and evaluate 3rd party and open source tools. You will have the opportunity to contribute to open source projects that we use internally and build tools to allow other departments to keep track of certificate status. You will design and implement alerts, write procedures for ops to handle such alerts, or be escalated-to around unresolved operational issues. You will also need to read and understand code from a legacy codebase to migrate logic to a modern services architecture and review the code of fellow engineers via pull requests.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Experience designing, coding, and implementing applications from the datastore to the public interface</li>\n<li>Awareness of the constraints around code performance, data storage and retrieval, caching, distributed systems, and customer needs</li>\n<li>BA/BS in Computer Science or equivalent experience</li>\n<li>5+ years of development experience</li>\n<li>Used statically typed languages (we use Golang)</li>\n<li>Willing to use (and learn, if needed) Go and Python on a regular basis</li>\n<li>Willing to use (and learn, if needed) PHP on a less-regular basis</li>\n<li>Experienced with designing, consuming, or implementing RESTful services</li>\n<li>Experienced with working with distributed systems, SOA, or microservices</li>\n<li>Working knowledge of traditional databases (PostgreSQL or other relational database)</li>\n<li>Passionate about writing reusable code that empowers other developers to work faster and smarter</li>\n<li>Can deliver well-tested code that enterprises can rely on</li>\n<li>Working source control knowledge including branching, merging, and rebasing (we use git)</li>\n<li>Strong work ethic and willingness to continuously improve</li>\n\n</ul>\n<strong>Bonus Points</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Experience with message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc)</li>\n<li>Experience working with a GLNP (Go, Linux, Nginx, PostgreSQL) stack</li>\n<li>Experience with PL/PGSQL stored procedures</li>\n<li>Experience with key-value data stores (Redis, HBase, HDFS, or other)</li>\n\n</ul>\n<strong>What Makes Cloudflare Special?</strong>\n<br><br>\nWe're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Project Galileo</strong>: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Project Athenian</strong>: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Path Forward Partnership</strong>: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.\n<br><br>\n<strong>1.1.1.1</strong>: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy policy and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\n<br><br>\nSound like something you'd like to be a part of? We'd love to hear from you!\n<br><br>\n<em>Cloudflare hires the best people based on an evaluation of their abilities and effectiveness.
