{"job title": "Sr. Applied Scientist", "company": "Amazon", "city state": "\u2013 US, WA, Seattle", "rating": "3.8", "job description": "We are building a small Science and ML Technology team to focus on improving the customer delivery experience by detecting patterns, trends, and insights \"hiding\" in massive amounts of data. Then, leveraging science and intelligent ML to highlight the biggest opportunities and systematically reduce and eliminate classes of defects in order of impact and importance. Our work will directly impact millions of daily package deliveries worldwide and help assure we keep our customer promise of delivering packages to the right place, at the right time, and with the right level of professionalism. We will continuously learn, innovate, and improve the Amazon customer delivery experience. If you have expert level skills and want to be part of this small special group read on, and apply.\n<br><br>\nAs the Science and ML technology team our job is to leverage big data to identify key patterns of success and failure, identify the areas we need to focus on first, understand root cause(s) that triggered failure, and to build predictive models that will help fix the most impactful problems. The amount of data, the variables that come into play, and diversity of customers and locations make this role very challenging and also fun. It starts with dealing with enough ambiguity thatll scare most people way, entails asking lots of smart question that will lead to the discovery of universal concepts, and truly innovative ML solutions that continuously improve the customer delivery experience.
