{"job title": "Postdoctoral Scientist (Molecular Mechanism of Cancer)", "company": "Cedars-Sinai", "city state": "\u2013 Los Angeles", "rating": "3.9", "job description": "This Postdoctoral Scientist opportunity is for an NIH-NCI supported laboratory of Dr. Jlenia Guarnerio in the Department of Radiation Oncology and Department of Biomedical Sciences at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA. The Guarnerio lab will focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms of cancer, with a particular emphasis on leukemia and sarcoma. We are interested in studying both cell-autonomous mechanisms responsible for cancer progression (e.g cancer expression profile), as well as non-cell-autonomous ones (e.g. derived from the tumor microenvironment). To dissect cancer-specific vulnerabilities, we will combine techniques of biochemistry, molecular biology, and Crispr/Cas9 technologies, together with next generation sequencing, multicolor flow cytometry, and the use of innovative mouse models. Our final goal is to identify novel therapeutic interventions for cancer, and new strategies of precision medicine.\n<br><br>\nFor this Postdoctoral Scientist position, the candidate would be expected to work independently on research projects designed in conjunction with Dr. Guarnerio. The Postdoctoral Scientist will assist in designing and conducting experiments, collection and analysis of data, preparation of data for publication and grant submission, presenting at both local and national meetings and applying for fellowships and grants. Teaching of other research staff, students, residents and fellows may be required.\n<br><br>\nPostdoctoral appointment will be for 1-3 years with the possibility for extension based on productivity and research.\n<br>"}
