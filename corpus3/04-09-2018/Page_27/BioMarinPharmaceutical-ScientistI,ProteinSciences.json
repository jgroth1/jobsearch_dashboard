{"job title": "Scientist I, Protein Sciences", "company": "BioMarin Pharmaceutical", "city state": "\u2013 San Rafael, California", "rating": "3.6", "job description": "BioMarin is the world leader in delivering therapeutics that provide meaningful advances to patients who live with serious and life-threatening rare genetic diseases. We target diseases that lack effective therapies and affect relatively small numbers of patients, many of whom are children. These conditions are often inherited, difficult to diagnose, progressively debilitating and have few, if any, treatment options. BioMarin will continue to focus on advancing therapies that are the first or best of their kind.\n<br><br>\nBioMarins Research &amp; Development group is responsible for everything from research and discovery to post-market clinical development. Research &amp; Development involves all bench and clinical research and the associated groups that support those endeavors. Our teams work on developing first-in-class and best-in-class therapeutics that provide meaningful advances to patients who live with rare diseases. Come join our team and make a meaningful impact on patients lives.<br><br><strong>SUMMARY DESCRIPTION</strong>\n<br><br>\nProtein Sciences Research is seeking a Scientist level I that will play an important role in the discovery-stage research of biotherapeutics as a member of the Protein Purification sub team. The Scientist I will work within multidisciplinary teams of scientists/research associates to provide experimental expertise in purifying and characterizing protein-based drug candidates or drug targets. He or she also will have the opportunity to develop processes that empower downstream production efforts to drive the rapid scale up of preclinical stage therapeutics. This position involves a unique blend of discovery, experimental, and development skills in protein science and process development to support both discovery- and development-stage processes for novel therapeutics.\n<br><br>\n<strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>\n<br><br>\nAs a Scientist I in the Protein Sciences group within the Research &amp; Drug Discovery department, the Scientist is responsible for providing expertise in experimental design and execution, data analysis, and problem solving using standard protein chemistry techniques to help discover and develop novel therapeutics for preclinical development.
