Expertise in developing bioinformatics tools using data mining and signal processing is highly recommended. We are seeking a computational biologist with research interests in the functional analysis of genome-wide datasets, in the context of metabolic research. An individual with background in the application or development of state-of-the art computational tools for evaluating Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies of transcription factors and epigenetic modifications/factors and large data sets are most highly desired. The most appropriate candidate will take advantage of close interactions with colleagues in IDOM, as well as the Cardiovascular Institute and Epigenetics Institute, which are co-localized in a new research building. Training in experimental biology and interest in systems biology, epigenetics/chromatin biology and/or metabolism would be useful, but not required. Examples of recent IDOM research involving analysis of big data include PMIDs 29760084, 29439026, 29517978, 28951829. For more information about the IDOM, see www.med.upenn.edu/idom.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Qualifications</strong>\n<br><br>\nThe minimum of a Master?s degree and 3 years to 5 years of experience or equivalent combination of education and experience required. An ideal candidate should have a Ph.D. in bioinformatics/computer science/physics or a related filed, be highly motivated in solving biological problems and have strong programming skills.\n<br><br>\nAffirmative Action Statement\n<br><br>\nPenn adheres to a policy that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, national or ethnic origin, citizenship status, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected class.\n<br><br>\nSpecial Requirements\n<br><br>\nQuick Link\n<br>\nhttp://jobs.hr.upenn.edu/postings/38691\n<br><br>\nPosting Supplemental Questions\n<br><br>\nRequired fields are indicated with an asterisk (*).\n<br><br>\n<strong>+ *</strong>\n<br>\nHow did you hear about this employment opportunity?\n<br><br>\n+ Jobs@Penn\n<br><br>\n+ Contacted by a Penn Recruiter\n<br><br>\n+ Referred by a Penn Employee\n<br><br>\n+ Referred by a friend or family member\n<br><br>\n+ Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC)\n<br><br>\n+ Inside Higher Ed\n<br><br>\n+ Indeed.com\n<br><br>\n+ Other Internet Advertisement\n<br><br>\n+ Linkedin\n<br><br>\n+ Twitter\n<br><br>\n+ Other Social Media Site\n<br><br>\n+ Professional Affiliation/Trade Website\n<br><br>\n+ Diversity Association/Publication Website\n<br><br>\n+ Heard about it at a conference or career fair\n<br><br>\n+ Apple One\n<br><br>\n+ Recruitment and/or staffing agency\n<br><br>\n<strong>+ *</strong>\n<br>\nWhat is your highest level of education completed?\n<br><br>\n+ Less than high school education\n<br><br>\n+ High School Diploma or GED\n<br><br>\n+ Vocational or Technical School\n<br><br>\n+ Associate's Degree or Two Year College\n<br><br>\n+ Bachelor's Degree\n<br><br>\n+ Master's Degree\n<br><br>\n+ PHD/MD/JD or equivalent doctoral degree\n<br><br>\n<strong>+ *</strong>\n<br>\nHow many years of experience do you have related to this position?\n<br><br>\n+ 0 to 1 Year\n<br><br>\n+ 1 to 2 Years\n<br><br>\n+ 2 to 3 Years\n<br><br>\n+ 3 to 5 Years\n<br><br>\n+ 5 to 7 Years\n<br><br>\n+ 7 to 10 Years\n<br><br>\n+ Over 10 Years\n<br><br>\nApplicant Documents\n<br><br>\nRequired Documents\n<br><br>\n+ Resume\n<br><br>\nOptional Documents\n<br><br>\n+ Cover Letter"}
