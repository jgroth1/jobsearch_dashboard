The SCDA will be experienced in clinical data and fluent in disease terminology to evaluate critically sources and quality of data being utilized to derive insights and be able to rapidly recognize inconsistencies and initiate resolution to data problems. Initial focus will be on identification of robust patient cohorts and associated treatment, biomarker and outcome data aimed at internal R&amp;D evaluation for product development, external publications as well as projects with clients based on their needs. The role will involve rapid prototyping of new solutions with the support of data scientists, data engineers and biostatisticians on the team, thus some experience with statistical programming (using SciPy/R/Shiny) will be required and experience with data science notebook environments (e.g. Jupyter, Google Datalab) would be beneficial. We seek an SCDA who will have the ability to drive projects, and who could eventually lead a team. The SCDA will report to the Director of Life Science Analytics and will support the Director and the SVP/head of the business unit in engaging both with internal management as well as client management to grow successfully the business unit and demonstrate impact on drug development R&amp;D and ultimately patient outcomes. The role has great potential for a successful candidate as they will form the initial seed of a new business unit with significant patient outcome and business potential.
