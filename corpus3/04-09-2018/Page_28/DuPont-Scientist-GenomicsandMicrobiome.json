The successful candidate will be part of the Genomics and Microbiome Sciences Group with primary focus on evaluating and interpreting multi-omic datasets from studies of probiotics and the microbiome. This position will be leveraged globally across multiple locations within DuPont Nutrition and Health division and will work cross-functionally with technical teams involved in upstream research, applications and manufacturing. The successful candidate will be responsible for developing analysis pipelines and applications for NGS data, including: amplicon, metagenomic, transcriptomics, and metabolomic data. This role requires strong programming skills, expertise with NGS analysis tools and construction of microbiome networks, as well as demonstrated experience integrating networks with biological and medical profiles to infer significant interactions. A critical aspect of the position involves working with teams across multiple locations, and will require effective project coordination and communication skills. This is an exciting opportunity for candidates with strong bioinformatic skills who want to work at the interface of the microbiome, probiotics, and clinical development. **KEY RESPONSIBILITIES**\n<br><br>\n+ Independently develops and implements multi-omic platforms, analytical procedures and data management tools to construct networks from probiotic and microbiome datasets.\n<br><br>\n+ Leads and collaborates on the interpretation of microbial structure and functional signatures from clinical and translational studies to transform critical insights from microbiome clinical studies to mechanisms of action and novel therapeutic probiotics.\n<br><br>\n+ Reconstructs genome-scale metabolic networks to aid in fermentation development.\n<br><br>\n+ Maintains thorough documentation of experimental plans, process workflows, and results.\n<br><br>\n+ Develops project plans in conjunction with Group manager.\n<br><br>\n+ Prepares results for presentation, inclusion in technical reports, and for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n<br><br>\n+ Stays current in bioinformatics methods / tools and emerging approaches in microbiome genomics and systems analyses by keeping up with relevant literature and attending scientific meetings.\n<br><br>\n+ Serves as a subject matter expert, resource, and mentor to biologists, wet lab scientists, and key stakeholders across the company **SCOPE OF POSITION** The incumbent will be a member of the Madison-based R&amp;D group, specifically the Genomics and Microbiome Sciences Group. In this role, they will be expected to conduct independent research as part of multifunctional project teams, based on specific business goals as set by the Health &amp; Protection leadership. As needed, the individual will be expected to lead projects and project teams. Direction will come from the Genomics and Microbiome Sciences Group manager. Research activities and responsibilities will be integrated into the overall global Technology as part of Health &amp; Protection within Nutrition and Health.The main objective is to perform bioinformatic analysis of large nucleic acid data sets derived from probiotic and clinical samples. These analyses will further understandings of probiotic health benefits, probiotic strain safety and diversity, and probiotic mode-of-action. A thorough understanding of nucleic acid sequence analysis algorithms and methods to integrate biological and medical datasets together are essential to developing new health claims and probiotics. It is expected that the incumbent will master specific technical skills commensurate with modern bioinformatics that include integrating multi-omic frameworks sufficiently to independently perform such work and instruct others as well. It is expected that the incumbent will perform their research in accordance with sound scientific principles, endeavor to maintain a current level of expertise in the area of bioinformatics and foster an attitude of innovation and creativity. Additionally, it is expected that the incumbent will develop sufficient understanding to relate basic and applied research activities towards business goals and directives.
