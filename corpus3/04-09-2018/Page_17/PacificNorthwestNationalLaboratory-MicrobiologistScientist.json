The mechanistic insights derived from these studies are expected to guide the design and engineering of microbial systems for controllable output. The work will integrate microbial physiology, genetics and continuous cultivation methods with high-throughput ?omics analyses, single-cell fluorescence measurements as well as initial mathematical analysis of experimental results to identify the interactions in multi-species communities. Areas of contribution include development of novel approaches to uncover structure-function relationships in multi-species assemblages and application of these techniques to study lab-based model systems as well as natural microbial communities. The selected applicant will initially work on funded projects from government sponsors but is expected to build extramurally funded research program and, as a principle investigator, demonstrate leadership skills.\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>*Minimum Qualifications**</li>\n</ul>\n\nBS/BA with 2 years of experience; MS/MA with 0 years of experience; PhD with 0 years of experience\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>*Preferred Qualifications**</li>\n</ul>\n\n? Candidates must have received a PhD or will receive a PhD within the next 3 months from an accredited college or university, or have received a Master?s Degree with at least 5 years of experience in research and development in an industrial or academic environment.\n<br><br>\n? PhD in microbiology, physiology, molecular biology, genetics, or a related biological field. Demonstrated ability to develop, lead, and safely execute research projects. Substantial record of independent contributions to research programs and extensive experience in technical and project leadership roles. Knowledge of continuous cultivation techniques and analytical techniques for measurement of extra- and intracellular metabolites is preferred. Previous research experience in microbial physiology and biochemistry of C1 and/or photosynthetic metabolism as demonstrated by a solid publication record is highly desirable. The successful candidate will interact with other staff and participate in team-based collaborative research within PNNL as well as with external organizations. Therefore, strong written, oral and inter-personal communication skills are essential to independently carry out initial analysis of experimental data, and present summaries to project managers and staff.\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>*Equal Employment Opportunity**</li>\n</ul>\n\nBattelle Memorial Institute (BMI) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity Employer and supports diversity in the workplace.
