Activities include sensor and system modeling, mission requirements analysis, and architecture development. A variety of technologies are examined, including radar, optical, acoustic, biological, and chemical sensors. Modeling and the analysis of field measurements are used to quantify the ability of current and proposed technology to meet mission requirements. This work includes analysis, algorithm development, and field testing.\n<br><br>\nThe candidate will work with technical staff on a broad range of analysis problems related to sensor design and system performance assessment. The work will require an ability to understand a variety of sensing modalities (e.g. electro-optical, radar), platforms (e.g. airborne) and end-to-end data exploitation techniques (e.g. signal processing, signature detection, automatic tracking, pattern recognition). Activities involve systems analysis, data analysis, physics-based modeling, and simulation, while working as a member of a technical team. The work will involve new concept and algorithm development, sensor system modeling, experiment design, and data-driven analysis.\n<br><br>\nRequirements: B.S. in Physics, Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Aeronautics/Astronautics, Computer Science, or related field with a strong background in physical sciences. A minimum GPA of 3.5 is required.\n<br><br>\nDesired skills: MATLAB, Python, or C++ programming experience is strongly desired.\n<br><br>\nMIT Lincoln Laboratory is an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) employer.
