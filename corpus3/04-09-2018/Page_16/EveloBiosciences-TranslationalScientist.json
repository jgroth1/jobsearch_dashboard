Evelo\u2019s product candidates are orally-delivered, single strains of microbes, selected for their defined pharmacological properties. They are intended to modulate systemic immunology and biology by acting on multiple naturally evolved biological pathways through the gut-body network. Evelo believes that monoclonal microbials have the potential to be broadly applicable across many diseases including immunoinflammatory, cancer, autoimmune, metabolic, neurological and neuroinflammatory diseases.\n<br><br>\nEvelo currently has several for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and for the treatment of cancer, for which ten clinical readouts are expected during 2019 and 2020. Evelo is also advancing additional candidates through preclinical development in other disease areas.\n<br><br>\nFor more information, please visit www.evelobio.com."}
