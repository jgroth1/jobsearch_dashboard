UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.\n<br><br>\nUW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.

From its beginning, the mission of ADAI has been to conduct and support substance abuse research at UW, and disseminate research findings on substance abuse.\n<br><br>\nThe ADAI has been the home for the Pacific Northwest Node of the National Institute on Drug Abuse\u2019s National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) since 2001. The CTN\u2019s goal is to move substance abuse treatments with demonstrated efficacy into community-based treatment settings to determine their effectiveness when implemented in real-world treatment settings.\n<br><br>\nThe Research Scientist position is at the intersection of substance abuse treatment and HIV prevention. The Research Scientist will function as the National Project Director for two HIV prevention studies in the CTN. One has been funded (http://ctndisseminationlibrary.org/protocols/ctn0082.htm) and is an HIV prevention implementation science survey study designed to identify barriers and facilitators to scaling up Pre-Exposure Phrophylaxis (PrEP) to substance-using men who have sex with men in high-HIV incidence cities in the US. A second study, awaiting funding, is a medication adherence trial of PrEP in substance-using men who have sex with men and in people who inject drugs. This position will work with Lead Investigators at ADAI, Columbia and Yale Universities, and with other Lead Team members, on the development, implementation, and dissemination of the studies. Secondarily, this position may involve work on other opioid-related clinical treatment trials on an as-needed basis.
