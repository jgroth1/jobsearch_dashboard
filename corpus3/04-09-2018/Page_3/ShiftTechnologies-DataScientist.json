We\u2019ve set out to transform an industry, using technology to bring transparency and convenience to the car buying process.</div> <br>\n<div>And we aren\u2019t stopping there. We aim to bring that same transparency and convenience to car ownership too, with payments, maintenance, and insurance in one easy app. At Shift, we\u2019re building the tools that empower people to buy, own, and sell the cars that make life go.</div><br>\n<div>Shift is bringing transparency and trust to the used car industry. Data is core to this transformation, from building best-in-class pricing, to loan decisioning, to logistics optimization, to in-product recommendations. If you\u2019re passionate about using data to fix an enormous, antiquated industry, you\u2019ll fit right in.</div><br>\n<div><strong>The Data</strong></div><div>Millions of cars are bought and sold in the US every year, but knowing exactly how much your car is worth is a challenge. We believe that fixing the used car industry requires providing customers with fair, detailed pricing reports in beautiful, easy-to-understand interfaces. By combining as much data as we can get our hands on, from the millions of listings available online, to car auction sales, to every vehicle\u2019s specific repair history, we\u2019re building the most accurate, transparent pricing tool in the industry.</div><br>\n<div><strong>The Impact</strong></div><div>As a two-sided marketplace, serving both car buyers and sellers, our vehicle data and pricing models are core to the business.
