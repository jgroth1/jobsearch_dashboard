{"job title": "Data Analyst I", "company": "Massachusetts General Hospital(MGH)", "city state": "\u2013 Boston, Massachusetts", "rating": "4.0", "job description": "<strong>GENERAL SUMMARY/ OVERVIEW STATEMENT:</strong>\n<br><br>\nThe Corrigan Minehan Heart Center at Massachusetts General Hospital is seeking exceptional candidates to join the lab of Dr. Steven Lubitz in the Cardiovascular Research Center. The candidate will join an interdisciplinary team of epidemiologists, senior statisticians, and clinicians, computational biologists, bioinformaticians, clinical informatics personnel, research coordinators, and research nurses who are working together to identify the causes of cardiac arrhythmias and identify methods to improve health outcomes.\n<br><br>\nProjects will focus on 1) identifying factors related to arrhythmias, 2) modeling strategies to improve health outcomes, and 3) implementing pragmatic interventions to diagnose arrhythmias and minimize morbidity. Current efforts include a large-scale randomized clinical trial focused on screening patients for atrial fibrillation, randomized implementation of atrial fibrillation risk prediction in clinical practice, and large-scale observational electronic health record research. The candidate will work with robust human health data derived from clinical data linked to electronic medical records from 7 academic hospitals spanning records for over 6 million individuals.\n<br><br>\nThe candidate will be a critical member of the lab organization. Primary roles will include the development and execution of statistical analysis plans, development of computational algorithms for database analysis, grant preparation, and manuscript writing. The candidate must thrive in an academic/professional atmosphere, where interdisciplinary teams are central to project success. A high level of maturity is essential, as the analyst is given access to personal and confidential medical information. Strong organizational and interpersonal skills, attention to detail, and the ability to prioritize multiple tasks are essential. The candidate must be self-motivated, independent in task completion, and comfortable accepting feedback and guidance from colleagues.\n<br><br>\nThis position is ideal for either individuals with a Masters degree in Biostatistics, Epidemiology, or Public Health with 1 to 2 years of real-world analytic experience, though exceptional candidates with less experience will be considered.
