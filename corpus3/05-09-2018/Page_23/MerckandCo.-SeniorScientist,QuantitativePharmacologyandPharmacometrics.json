{"job title": "Senior Scientist, Quantitative Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics", "company": "Merck and Co.", "city state": "\u2013 Rahway, NJ", "rating": "3.7", "job description": "Senior scientists in Quantitative Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics (QP2) apply quantitative approaches to develop and implement translational PK/PD strategies, characterize clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of new chemical entities and biologics, and inform dose selection and go/no-go decisions. Senior Scientists work in collaborative teams with more experienced scientists, and are expected to have or develop expertise in one or more areas necessary to performing primary responsibilities including:\n<br><br>\nBeing or supporting the lead representative for QP2 on drug/vaccine development teams\n<br>\nData management and analysis\n<br>\nFraming critical drug development questions for optimizing model-based development\n<br>\nDeveloping and executing translational PK/PD approaches, population pharmacokinetic models, exposure-response and stratification biomarker models, quantitative system pharmacology (QSP) and disease progression models, clinical trial design via outcome/enrollment modeling and simulation, comparator modeling, absorption/biopharmaceutical modeling, clinical utility index modeling, and other model-based analyses.\n<br>\nSenior Scientists are expected to develop a comprehensive understanding of global regulatory expectations for small molecules, biologics, and/or vaccines, including support for regulatory documents (INDs, CSRs, CTDs), and agency interactions. The Senior Scientist is a proficient modeler, is able to develop a strong, integrated understanding of the strategic elements of drug discovery and development, and contributes to or leads the combined efforts of QP2 and the wider Department of Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Drug Metabolism (PPDM).\n<br><br>\nSenior Scientists begin to develop leadership skills in areas such as mentoring, managing a program (while collaborating with QP2 Program Lead), project, or initiative. In addition to the responsibilities outlined above, Senior Scientists demonstrate good communication skills, collaborating within QP2 and with other functional areas, as well as with external vendors and partners, creating an aligned, quantitative framework to impact decisions of drug development teams.\n<br>\n<strong>Qualifications\n<br><br>\nRequired:</strong>\n<br>\nMaster or equivalent degree with at least four years of experience, where \u201cexperience\u201d means having a record of increasing responsibility and independence in a similar role in pharmaceutical drug development or academia.\n<br>\nPh.D. or equivalent degree - OR- a PharmD or equivalent degree with at least two years of experience or an educational background in biopharmaceutics, pharmaceutical sciences, pharmacometrics, mathematics, statistics/ biostatistics, computational biology/chemistry, chemical/biomedical engineering, or a related field.\n<br>\nProficiency in R, Matlab, SAS, or other similar programing language\n<br>\nPreferred:\n<br><br>\nExperience in performing population PK / PKPD and non-compartmental analyses\n<br>\nExperience with standard pharmacometric software (e.g. NONMEM, Monolix, Phoenix, etc.)\n<br>\nSkills in experimental design, mathematical problem solving, critical data analysis/interpretation, and statistics\n<br>\nScientific understanding of biopharmaceutical and ADME properties\n<br>\nProficiency in written and verbal communication, interdisciplinary collaboration, and problem scoping and planning"}
