Online Advertising is one of the fastest growing businesses on the Internet today, with about $70 billion of a $600 billion advertising market already online. Search engines, web publishers, major ad networks, and ad exchanges are now serving billions of ad impressions per day and generating terabytes of user events data every day. The rapid growth of online advertising has created enormous opportunities as well as technical challenges that demand computational intelligence. Computational Advertising has emerged as a new interdisciplinary field that involves information retrieval, machine learning, data mining, statistics, operations research, and micro-economics, to solve challenging problems that arise in online advertising. The central problem of computational advertising is to select an optimized slate of eligible ads for a user to maximize a total utility function that captures the expected revenue, user experience and return on investment for advertisers.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Skills&amp;Qualifications:</strong>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Outstanding expertise and hands-on experience on machine learning, text analysis, data mining, and NLP</li>\n<li>8+ years experience in software development</li>\n<li>Knowledge of C#, C++, Java or Python</li>\n<li>MS/PhD degree in CS/EE or related areas is preferred</li>\n<li>Passionate, self-motivated</li>\n<li>Effective communication skills, both verbal and written</li>\n<li>Familiarity with distributed data processing/analysis and modeling paradigm, such as Map-Reduce and MPI is a plus</li>\n</ul>\n\nMicrosoft is an equal opportunity employer.
