This was just one of the ten thousand A/B experiments that we ran last year, powered by ExP, Microsoft?s Analysis and Experimentation team. We are building a world-class experimentation platform that accelerates innovation for partners across Microsoft. The ability to experiment is credited as one of the key reasons that Bing quickly closed the gap on Google. We are now at the next phase of our mission: bring Bing?s innovation process through experimentation to the rest of Microsoft and beyond. Come and join us in the revolution!\n<br><br>\nAs a data scientist on ExP, you will spend most of your time working with partners around Microsoft with a goal of getting them to run A/B experiments at scale. You?ll work deeply with their data to establish quality and unlock insights. You?ll work with their leadership to identify the core signals that indicate success, along with the additional metrics that are leading indicators of success. You will also spend time directly with experimenters on their experiments, ensuring they are designed, executed, and analyzed correctly and in a trustworthy fashion.\n<br><br>\nAs your career grows in ExP, you will have many opportunities to expand the state of the art of experimentation, not just for ExP but for the world.\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>*Responsibilities**</li>\n</ul>\n\nAs a data scientist on ExP, you will spend most of your time working with partners around Microsoft with a goal of getting them to run A/B experiments at scale.
