UCP was created in 1992 to manage a number of unique programs requested by the UCAR community.\n<br><br>\nThe Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science (CPAESS) develops customizable solutions to complex scientific challenges by fostering scientific leadership and workforce, building community collaborations, and facilitating the advancement of research for the benefit of society. CPAESS facilitates and manages scientific research and research-to-operations appointments for early career and expert scientists at US institutions, federal laboratories and program offices. CPAESS collaborates with the community to provide an array of scientific opportunities that promote lifelong professional and workforce development and that fosters a new generation of leaders within the scientific community.\n<br><br>\n<strong>What You Will Do:</strong>\n<br><br>\nThis position will focus on development of tidal datum transformations for NOAA\u2019s VDatum vertical datum transformation project. NOAA has developed a new methodology to blend together datums from tide model results and tide gauge observations that improves the quality of tidal datum transformations. This new method also calculates the spatially varying uncertainty in the blended tidal datum fields. The person hired for this position will work with NOAA scientists on applying this new methodology to U.S. coastal regions where VDatum is available. The person will be responsible for running ADCIRC tide model simulations on NOAA\u2019s High Performance Computers to generate tidal datum predictions. Existing Matlab and Fortran programs will then be used to compute the blended tidal datum product and its associated spatially-varying uncertainty. The candidate will work with the VDatum team of scientists and prepare these tidal datum results for use in VDatum software applications.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Responsibilities:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Perform oceanographic data analysis to compute statistical information from outputs of tide model simulations.</li>\n\n<li>Run tide simulations with the ADCIRC coastal hydrodynamic model using pre-existing grids and input files.</li>\n\n<li>Apply the tidal datum statistical interpolation tool to produce the blended model-data tidal datum product and conduct quality control analysis.</li>\n\n<li>Apply the statistical interpolation tool to compute the spatially varying uncertainty of the tidal datum product.</li>\n\n<li>Coordinate with NOAA\u2019s VDatum team on applying the tidal datum method to new regions and deliver the results of the tidal datum analyses for application in the VDatum software application.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><br>\n<strong>What You Need:</strong>\n<br><br>\nEducation and Years of Experience:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bachelor\u2019s degree and three to five years of experience in Oceanography, Geography, Meteorology, Civil Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science, or Physics required; or an equivalent combination of education and experience.</li>\n</ul>\nKnowledge, Skills, and Abilities:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Strong knowledge and experience with oceanographic data processing and analysis.</li>\n\n<li>Knowledge and experience in scientific computer programming, especially with Fortran and Matlab.</li>\n\n<li>Skill working within the Linux environment and with high performance computing platforms.</li>\n\n<li>Knowledge of scientific statistical analyses is desirable.</li>\n\n<li>Knowledge of oceanographic hydrodynamic modeling including the ability to conduct model simulations and analyze the results.</li>\n\n<li>Strong ability to work independently as well as with a diverse team.</li>\n\n<li>Excellent oral and written communication skills with an emphasis in technical communication.</li>\n\n<li>Well-developed skills in planning and organizing project and program objectives.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><br>\n<strong>Applicant Notes:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This position may be subject to work location requirements for obtaining access to facilities and research systems.
