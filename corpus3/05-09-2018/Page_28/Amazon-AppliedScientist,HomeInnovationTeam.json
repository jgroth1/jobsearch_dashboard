{"job title": "Applied Scientist, Home Innovation Team", "company": "Amazon", "city state": "\u2013 US, WA, Seattle", "rating": "3.8", "job description": "In the US 65% of households (or 79.7 million homes) own a pet. 60% of these pet owners consider their pets to be family members. We are the Pets Tech Team - a group of engineers, product managers and designers focused on helping pet owners discover and purchase the right products for their pets. Our customers care for their pets, and Amazon cares too. The business is growing fast, and most important the team is building features that impact hundreds of millions of customers!\n<br><br>\n<strong>THE CHALLENGES WE WILL TACKLE</strong>\n<br>\nAs with every project within Amazon, we work backwards from our customer's needs, address the problems they meet and innovate on new technologies. Our team will tackle some tough problems such as:\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Simplify the process of choosing the right products for your pet through searching, browsing, and recommendations.</li>\n<li>Personalize customers' search and shopping experiences to help them find useful products for their pets. These preferences will be automatically inferred or directly declared by our customers.</li>\n<li>Make Amazon a trusted resource for all the pet products, by better understanding pet product attributes.</li>\n<li>Provide expert advice and information to help guide our customers in their decision making process.</li>\n</ul>\n\nWe are a tightly knit group that share our experiences and help each other succeed. We love hard problems and like to move fast in a growing team and changing environment. We use data to guide our decisions and we always push the technology and process boundaries of what is feasible on behalf of our customers. The most successful members of our team are obsessed with helping our customers in creative ways, bring clarity to ambiguity through data driven experimentation and have bias for action. If that sounds like an environment you like, join us.\n<br><br>\nYou will be an Applied Scientist. The work that we will do in our team will succeed only if we make full use of the Amazon data and help our customers find the right products for their preferences &amp; needs. You will be at the core of this effort - working to improve the product descriptions, the search algorithms, creating new experiences and personalization algorithms. It will require skill in understanding complex user scenarios, finding and implementing the right algorithms and ultimately a data driven approach to deliver results.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Major responsibilities:</strong>\n<br>\n\u00b7 Develop machine learning and analytical techniques for intelligent information retrieval/classification system to solve business problems.\n<br>\n\u00b7 Design, develop and deploy highly scalable machine learning models.\n<br>\n\u00b7 Analyze and understand large amounts of Amazons historical business data.\n<br>\n\u00b7 Working closely with software engineering teams to build machine learning based features &amp; products\n<br>\n\u00b7 Establish scalable, efficient, automated processes for large scale data analyses, model development, model validation and model implementation\n<br>\n\u00b7 Track business impact of the science work and providing clear updates\n<br>\n\u00b7 Mentor others in the use of ML techniques\n<br><br>"}
