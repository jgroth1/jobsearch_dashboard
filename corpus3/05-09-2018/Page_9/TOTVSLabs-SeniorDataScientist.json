Here\u2019s the description of each column:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>customer_code: unique id of a customer;</li>\n<li>branch_id: the branch id where this order was made;</li>\n<li>sales_channel: the sales channel this order was made;</li>\n<li>seller_code: seller that made this order;</li>\n<li>register_date: date of the order;</li>\n<li>total_price: total price of the order (sum of all items);</li>\n<li>order_id: id of this order;</li>\n<li>quantity: quantity of items, given by item_code, were bought;</li>\n<li>item_total_price: total price of items, i.e., quantity* price;</li>\n<li>unit_price: unit price of this item;</li>\n<li>group_code: which group this customer belongs;</li>\n<li>segment_code: segment this client belongs;</li>\n<li>is_churn: if this client is set as a churn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Question 1 (10 Points) </strong></p>\n<p>List as many use cases for the dataset as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 2 (10 Points) </strong></p>\n<p>Pick one of the use cases you listed in question 1 and describe how building a statistical model based on the dataset could best be used to improve the business this data comes from.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 3 (20 Points) </strong></p>\n<p>Implement the model you described in question 2, preferably in Python. The code has to retrieve the data, train and test a statistical model, and report relevant performance criteria. Ideally, we should be able to replicate your analysis from your submitted source-code, so please explicit the versions of the tools and packages you are using.</p>\n<p><strong>Question 4 (60 Points) </strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li> Explain each and every of your design choices, you can use jupyter notebooks. (e.g., preprocessing, model selection, hyper parameters, evaluation criteria). Compare and contrast your choices with alternative methodologies. </li>\n<li> Describe how you would improve the model in Question 3 if you had more time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can find the dataset for this challenge in the following url:<br>https://github.com/totvslabs/datachallenge/raw/master/challenge.zip</p>"}
