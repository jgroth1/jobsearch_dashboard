This involves having a deep understanding of microphysical processes of liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds and how those processes are perturbed by aerosols. The candidate is also expected to be familiar with organic gas- and particle-phase chemistry associated with the formation, growth, and aging of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) since and their effect on cloud condensation and ice nuclei (CCN &amp; IN). You will be expected to have an understanding of how aerosol properties affect cloud formation and lifetimes, absorption and scattering of light, and how meteorological processes influence the aerosol lifecycle. A strong grasp of aerosol mixing state, transport over multiple scales, and fate via wet removal and dry deposition of particles is desirable. Hypotheses regarding new process-level understanding of cloud-aerosol interactions will be evaluated within a multi-scale modeling context and rigorously evaluated using a wide range meteorological, chemical, and aerosol field campaign measurements. Knowledge of measurement uncertainty and its effect on the interpretation of model predictions is important.\n<br><br>\nYou will be expected to work as part of a team of scientists at PNNL with experience in both measuring and modeling aerosols. Ultimately, you will be expected to develop your own hypotheses and execute a research plan that addresses those hypotheses.\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>*Minimum Qualifications**</li>\n</ul>\n\nMinimum Education Requirement: BS/BA 2 years? experience, MS 0 years? experience, PhD 0 years? experience\n<br><br>\nTechnical Expertise: Contributing professional who is building a professional reputation for technical expertise.
