The department has a national reputation for high quality teaching and an international reputation for excellence in research. Because of the revolution in biology that began in the 1970s, rapid advances in microbiology and the development of biotechnology have increased our understanding of all living systems. This has in large part been determined by studies of microorganisms. The research programs of the faculty in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Washington reflect exciting areas of modern microbiology. Our faculty span a broad range of interests including microbial ecology, physiology, virology, and microbial pathogenesis in both animal and plant systems. The members of our department are largely concerned with understanding the mechanisms by which organisms interact with one another and with their environment at the cellular and molecular levels. Because of the strong interdisciplinary nature of these interests, numerous collaborative efforts between our faculty and those in other science and medicine departments have developed.\n<br><br>\nThe Department of Microbiology currently has an outstanding opportunity for a <strong>RESEARCH SCIENTIST 1</strong>.\n<br><br>\nThis role is expected to perform meticulous investigative laboratory work in support of research into the pathogenesis of HIV-disease (AIDS), specifically relating to the understanding of HIV latency and vaccine development.\n<br><br>\nWork is performed under the supervision of and in support of research goals developed by principal investigator, postdoctoral fellow or research scientist.
