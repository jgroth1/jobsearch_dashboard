{"job title": "Machine Learning Scientist, Amazon Alexa", "company": "Amazon", "city state": "\u2013 US, WA, Seattle", "rating": "3.8", "job description": "Alexa is the Amazon cloud service that powers Echo, the groundbreaking Amazon device designed around your voice. We believe voice is the most natural user interface for interacting with the web services and applications. Alexa uses a suite of foundational machine learned (ML) classifiers such as Conditional Random Fields, Hidden Markov models, and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).\n<br><br>\nA Senior Machine Learning Scientist with our Alexa team will help drive Alexas core deep learning technologies. A successful candidate will be expected to:\n<br><br>\n\u00b7 Innovate and execute on foundational ML algorithms that spans Deep Learning and data-efficient learning techniques such as Transfer Learning (i.e. applying learning from one task to another), Single-/Zero-Shot learning (i.e. learning from a small number of labeled samples), and Unsupervised Learning\n<br>\n\u00b7 Partner with engineering teams to productize enhancements and new ML algorithms for large-scale application\n<br>\n. Help interview and hire other scientists and engineers\n<br><br>\n. Mentor other scientists and engineers, review and guide their work, help develop roadmaps for the team, provide coaching for career development\n<br><br>"}
