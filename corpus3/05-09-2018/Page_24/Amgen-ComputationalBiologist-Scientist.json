{"job title": "Computational Biologist - Scientist", "company": "Amgen", "city state": "\u2013 South San Francisco, CA", "rating": "3.7", "job description": "The Genome Analysis Unit (GAU) is seeking a talented computational biologist to join our team and further our mission of making biological discoveries that accelerate target and drug discovery and safety at Amgen. The scientist will be part of the computational biology group in the GAU, which operates collaboratively on multiple therapeutic areas across Discovery Research and Preclinical Development. The position focuses on the application of bioinformatics expertise to the analysis and interpretation of large datasets to support ongoing drug development projects in close collaboration with project teams. These datasets include in vitro and in vivo assay results, RNA expression, genetics, and high value public resources. Additionally, the role will involve the creation of novel algorithms and analytical approaches that can be used to both identify new drug targets as well as predict the safety profile of our molecules and thus increase clinical success rates.\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>*Responsibilities:**</li>\n</ul>\n\no Apply advanced techniques in bioinformatics, statistical analysis, and programming to biological problems across a wide range of human disease and drug safety areas at Amgen\n<br><br>\no Work with large internal and external biological data sets including Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data (e.g. RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, WGS)\n<br><br>\no Interface directly with project teams and key stakeholders within Amgen to ensure the appropriate and timely inclusion of relevant datasets\n<br><br>\no Integrate work tightly with wet lab efforts within the GAU, Discovery Research and CBSS focused on predictive safety and target validation\n<br><br>\no Represent group internally and externally through presentations, publications, networks, collaborations and conferences to promote approaches and raise the profile of work within the team.\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>*Basic Qualifications:**</li>\n</ul>\n\nDoctorate degree\n<br><br>\n<strong>OR</strong>\n<br><br>\nMaster's degree and 4 years of scientific experience\n<br><br>\n<strong>OR</strong>\n<br><br>\nBachelor's degree and 6 years of scientific experience\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>*Preferred Qualifications:**</li>\n</ul>\n\nAdvanced degree in Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Computer Science, Genomics\n<br><br>\nHands-on experience in the fields of bioinformatics and genomics including working with\n<br><br>\nvarious public and proprietary data repositories (e.g., TCGA, GTEx, dbGaP, Ensembl, UCSC\n<br><br>\ngenome browser, Array Studio), bioinformatics tools (e.g., BLAST, GATK, Cell Ranger, samtools, VEP), and statistical environments (e.g., R, S+, Matlab)\n<br><br>\nExperience with manipulation, interpretation, and innovative analysis (e.g. novel algorithm development) of large biological datasets, including single-cell sequencing data\n<br><br>\nResearch experience in the field of neuroscience\n<br><br>\nProficient in programming (e.g., Python, Java, C/C++) and working in a Unix/Linux environment; ability to develop customized bioinformatics tools\n<br><br>\nAmgen is an Equal Opportunity employer and will consider all qualified applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, protected veteran status, or disability status.\n<br><br>\nAmgen will consider for employment qualified applicants with criminal histories in a manner consistent with the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance."}
