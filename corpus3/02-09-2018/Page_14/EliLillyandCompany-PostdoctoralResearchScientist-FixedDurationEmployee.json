We are a global healthcare leader headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. Our 39,000 employees around the world work to discover and bring life-changing medicines to those who need them, improve the understanding and management of disease, and give back to our communities through philanthropy and volunteerism. We give our best effort to our work, and we put people first. We're looking for people who are determined to make life better for people around the world. Responsibilities Responsibilities:<br><br>You will operate in a dynamic and cross functional environment, working closely with discovery scientists, IT, and statisticians to enable research related to drug discovery and development with a specific focus on immunogenicity. You will share standard methodologies with others with the opportunity to adopt new methods. This entails using molecular profiles and multiple in-vitro and in-silico databases to help understand mechanisms of immunogenicity and then to use this information to help drug discovery progression and define risk patient population. Are you highly familiar with biological research related to innate or antigen-specific T cell response? We could use your expertise.<br><br>Key Objectives/Deliverables<br><br>* Analysis of antigen-specific and innate responses to biotherapeutics in human PBMCs with omics approaches.<br><br>* Analysis of data from a genomic perspective to support internal efforts, additional indications, and publications.<br><br>* Propose, conduct analysis, and provide interpretation supporting key project aims. Present results and provide scientific reports as needed or requested by the project teams as a component of project reviews, landmarks or governance in a manner fit for cross-functional team consumption.<br><br>* Use internal and external data sources such as but not limited to genome variation, genotype-phenotype association, molecularly characterized disease state databases, etc., to routinely deliver assimilated information and insights relating to target of interest or pathway of interest, appropriateness of pre-clinical models, mechanistic understanding in immunogenicity studies, biomarkers supporting immunogenicity risk assessment and possible identification of at-risk population.<br><br>* Apply expertise in IT Informatics and Statistics. Collaborate around data analysis methods and application. Engage IT capabilities and infrastructure team to help meet data storage and data processing needs. Work with the application development group to help develop and implement solutions for data access and visualization for the broader Lilly scientific community.<br><br>* Provide analysis or related support as needed in context of collaborations with cross functional teams.
