If you are interested please apply with resume to .\n<br><br>\nDescription:\n<br><br>\nAt high level, this person will contribute to the design, development and delivery of a data mart on Azure, using mostly MSBI toolsets.\n<br><br>\nKey to success is outstanding data skills (modeling, SQL, ability to envision the best way to assemble data for usable data consumption) and ability to think outside the box. Significant experience is a must. But don't come expecting to know how to do this: we will figure it out together, there will be many new tools, modeling approaches, usage patterns to consider.\n<br><br>\nThis is a hands-on role. Key contributions will be in the design and approach, but also in execution. Non-coders need not apply. Outstanding SQL is a must. ETL tool is not yet clear, perhaps SSIS, perhaps Kafka, perhaps something else. Thus flexibility and ability to learn quickly is mandatory.\n<br><br>\nI am building a small team of just me and two others, so those two need to be really strong. We will be working on our own, blazing new ground... but closely aligned with several other engineering teams working on related data in other databases on the same Azure platform. So lots of sharing of ideas and approaches, but our work will be just the three of us.\n<br>\nSQL. MSBI full stack (early phase will focus on data movement, but in order to design for future work, strong skills in PowerBI / Tabular Models / Cubes are needed to enhance data design). Data modeling. ETL.\n<br><br>\nExperience with Azure, cloud databases, dynamic scalability, Kafka, Spark, Python"}
