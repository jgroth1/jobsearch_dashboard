{"job title": "SCIENTIST, CANCER BIOLOGY", "company": "Tango Therapeutics", "city state": "\u2013 Cambridge, MA, US", "rating": "NA", "job description": "<p><strong>Company Overview</strong></p><br>\n<p>Tango, a 2017 \u201cFierce 15\u201d company, is an exciting new oncology company launched by Third Rock Ventures, one of Boston\u2019s premier biotech funding groups. Our focus is on exploiting synthetic lethal interactions to discover and develop new breakthrough cancer therapies.<br><br>Our discovery efforts begin and end with patients. We invert the traditional discovery paradigm by putting patient selection before target identification. We use deep DNA sequencing and CRISPR-based screening to identify novel targets for specific subgroups of cancer patients. Our goal is to leverage the principles of synthetic lethality to find novel weaknesses in cancer cells and use them to provide a roadmap to cures. As we advance our molecules into the clinic, our trials will enroll the patients most likely to benefit from our new treatments; thereby enabling greater speed, success, and impact for those patients.<br><br></p><br>\n<p><strong>Job Summary</strong></p><br>\n<p>We are seeking a motivated and scientifically rigorous scientist to perform laboratory-based research in a collaborative, multidisciplinary team environment.
