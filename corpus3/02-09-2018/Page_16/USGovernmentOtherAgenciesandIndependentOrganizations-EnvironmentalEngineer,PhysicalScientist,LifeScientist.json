Degree: professional engineering. To be acceptable, the curriculum must: (1) be in a school of engineering with at least one curriculum accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) as a professional engineering curriculum; or (2) include differential&amp;integral calculus and courses (more advanced than first-year physics&amp;chemistry) in five of the following seven areas of engineering science or physics: (a) statics, dynamics; (b) strength of materials (stress-strain relationships); (c) fluid mechanics, hydraulics; (d) thermodynamics; (e) electrical fields&amp;circuits; (f) nature&amp;properties of materials (relating particle&amp;aggregate structure to properties); and (g) any other comparable area of fundamental engineering science or physics, such as optics, heat transfer, soil mechanics, or electronics.\n<br><br>\n<strong>OR</strong>\n<br><br>\nB. Combination of education&amp;experience-college-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the physical and mathematical sciences underlying professional engineering,&amp;(2) a good understanding, both theoretical&amp;practical, of the engineering sciences&amp;techniques&amp;their applications to one of the branches of engineering. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following:\n<br><br>\nProfessional registration -Current registration as a professional engineer by any State, the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard, those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions.\n<br><br>\nWritten Test -Evidence of having successfully passed the Engineer-in-Training (EIT) examination, or the written test required for professional registration, which is administered by the Boards of Engineering Examiners in the various States, the District of Columbia, Guam,&amp;Puerto Rico. Applicants who have passed the EIT examination&amp;have completed all the requirements for either (a) a bachelor's degree in engineering technology (BET) from an accredited college of university that included 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical,&amp;engineering sciences, or (b) a BET from a program accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) may be rated eligible for certain engineering positions at GS-5. Eligibility is limited to positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of the engineering technology program. Applicants for positions that involve highly technical research, development, or similar functions requiring an advanced level of competence in basic science must meet the basic requirements in paragraph A. Because of the diversity in kind&amp;quality of BET programs, graduates of other BET programs are required to complete at least 1 year of additional education or highly technical work experience of such nature as to provide reasonable assurance of the possession of the knowledge, skills,&amp;abilities required for professional engineering competence. The adequacy of this background must be demonstrated by passing the EIT examination. Specified academic courses -- Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical, mathematical,&amp;engineering sciences&amp;in engineering that included the courses specified in the basic requirements. The courses must be fully acceptable toward meeting the requirements of a professional engineering curriculum as described in paragraph A. related curriculum -- Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in engineering technology or in an appropriate professional field, e.g., physics, chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology, may be accepted in lieu of a degree in engineering, provided the applicant has had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type experience, e.g., interdisciplinary positions. (The above examples of related curricula are not all-inclusive.)\n<br><br>\nNote: An applicant who meets the basic requirements as specified in A or B above may qualify for positions in any branch of engineering unless selective factors indicate otherwise, or unless he/she qualifies under the provisions of B.2 related to the EIT examination or BET degree.\n<br><br>\nPhysical Science - 1301\n<br><br>\nA. Degree: physical science, engineering, or mathematics that included 24 semester hours in physical science and/or related engineering science such as mechanics, dynamics, properties of materials, and electronics.\n<br><br>\nIn addition to the educational requirements, we are looking for at least one year of specialized experience related to this position as described below:\n<br><br>\nTo qualify for the GS-07 level, you need to have at least one year of full-time experience equivalent to the GS-05 level defined as: Providing general guidance and advice on environmental issues, and assist in the review of scientific or technical documents. - OR 1 full year of graduate level education; or superior academic achievement (Superior Academic Achievement Definition) degree in the academic discipline as described below.\n<br><br>\nTo qualify for the GS-09 level, you need to have at least one year of full-time experience equivalent to the GS-07 level defined as: Providing policy and/or procedural guidance on environmental issues, assist in the production or review of scientific/technical documents, and provide stakeholders or others with advice on environmental issues. - OR master's or equivalent graduate degree; or 2 full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to such a degree in the academic discipline as described below.\n<br><br>\nLife Science-0401\n<br><br>\nA. Degree: biological sciences, agriculture, natural resource management, chemistry, or related disciplines appropriate to the position.\n<br><br>\n<strong>OR</strong>\n<br><br>\nB. Combination of education and experience: Courses equivalent to a major, as shown in A above, plus appropriate experience or additional education.\n<br><br>\nYour answers to the online assessment will be used to evaluate your competencies in the following areas:\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Knowledge of and skill in applying professional engineering, physical or biological science theories, principles and methods to determine and/or execute a wide range of developmental assignments involving conventional features and problems, projects, or studies that may include several environmental conditions and varying environmental processes.</li>\n<li>Skill in using standard data gathering and analysis techniques to collect and review technical information on environmental activities and to identify and solve problems of a procedural or factual nature</li>\n<li>Knowledge of applicable environmental laws, regulations, statutes, policies and guidelines sufficient to perform well-precedented and recurring assignments and to determine compliance with federal requirements.</li>\n<li>Ability to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, to write technical reports and letters and to make presentations to various types of audiences.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Education</strong>\n<br><br>\nAs part of the application process, you are required to submit college transcripts or a list of courses as described in the Required Documents section of this announcement. However, if you are selected, you must provide official educational transcripts before you start work with EPA.
