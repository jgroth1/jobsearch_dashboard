We offer a wide variety of competitive benefits, services and programs that provide our employees the resources to pursue their goals, both at work and in their personal lives.\n<br><br>\nBristol-Myers Squibb has expanded the large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Devens, Massachusetts. The expansion included biologics development and clinical trial manufacturing capabilities to the site. Both represent new capabilities for Devens, a site that in its early years has focused solely on large-scale, bulk biologics manufacturing.\n<br><br>\nThis position will be part of a newly established group in Devens, MA that is responsible for manufacturing process development of microbial and new modality assets, which are mostly non-platform. Additionally, this group will be overseeing the technical aspect of the externalization of our portfolio work, including both microbial- and mammalian-based. Furthermore, this position will provide technical oversight to the new modality asset's manufacturing process development in our pipeline, such as non-platform viral products (gene therapy, CAR-T, etc.) and clinical manufacturing at various third-party vendors. This role is within the Biologics Development organization at Devens, MA.\n<br><br>\nSpecifically, this person will be part of a team to develop downstream processes in partnership with upstream development groups for both early and late stage non-mammalian products. Functional responsibilities here include experimental work for process development and characterization. This role will also include tech transfer and monitoring activities with third party organizations for a growing pipeline of new modality assets including non-platform viral products (gene therapy, CAR-T), etc. Thus, this might necessitate travel up to 10%. The candidate will actively partner with the overall downstream team, Manufacturing, MS&amp;T, Analytics, Project Management, and R&amp;D groups in a matrix, team organization to achieve a seamless and platform purification process approach.. The candidate will also present and report results to senior leadership within the Biologics Process Development organization.\n<br><br>\nKey Responsibilities\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Certain amount of hands-on operation needed for downstream process development.</li>\n<li>Design, execution and data interpretation of laboratory experiments as well as providing guidance to team members</li>\n<li>Support process development, process characterization and scale up activities to both CRO and CMO sites.</li>\n<li>Prepare/review technical documents including development /tech transfer reports, batch records, SOPs and CMC regulatory submissions.</li>\n<li>Participate on cross-functional teams to progress both early and late stage drug candidates.</li>\n<li>Train junior team members in lab operations.</li>\n<li>Recommend innovative new technologies and perform the necessary experiments for evaluation and implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Qualifications:</strong>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ph.D.: Chemical/Biochemical Engineering, Biochemistry, Biophysics, or equivalent with a minimum of 3+ years of industry and/or academic experience or a MS/BS with a minimum of 7+ years of industry and/or academic experience</li>\n<li>In depth understanding and hands on experience in downstream process development, preferably for virus and microbial products other than mAbs</li>\n<li>Knowledge of virus purification for gene therapy is highly preferred.</li>\n<li>Managerial ability to lead matrix teams</li>\n<li>Knowledge of statistical experimental design and data analysis.</li>\n<li>Knowledge of cGMPs as applied to process development and scale up.</li>\n<li>Knowledge of mammalian cell culture and downstream processing</li>\n<li>Ability to work collaboratively in a team and matrix environment</li>\n<li>Excellent oral and written communication skills</li>\n<li>Ability for travel of approximately 10%</li>\n</ul>"}
