The successful candidate will play a critical role in fulfilling the broad goals of the lab's recently funded NIH grant:\n<br><br>\n(1) develop new methods to measure the circadian system in single cells and in humans living in the real world\n<br><br>\n(2) use publicly available data to understand how the circadian clocks in each organ communicate with one another\n<br><br>\n(3) use data from electronic medical records to explore the link between the circadian system and human phenotypes.\n<br><br>\nThe lab has a rich set of collaborators, from experimental biologists to clinical researchers. Depending on the candidate's background and interest, there is the opportunity to help design wet-lab experiments or human studies and to analyze the resulting data.\n<br><br>\nThe Hughey Lab is part of the Department of Biomedical Informatics and the Vanderbilt Center for Precision Medicine.<br><br>Basic Qualifications<br><br>Strong candidates will have a PhD or equivalent in a quantitative / computational field and experience with biological or clinical data.\n<br><br>\nIndividuals with a PhD in the biological sciences and a strong quantitative background will also be considered.\n<br><br>\nPrevious experience in circadian rhythms is not necessary. More important than having any particular technical skills, the individual must be hard-working, creative, and eager to learn.<br><br>Key Functions and Expected Performances<br><br>1.
