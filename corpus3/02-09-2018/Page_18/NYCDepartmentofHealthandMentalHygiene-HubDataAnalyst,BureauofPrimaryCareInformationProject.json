The PCIP works with over 1,300 health care organizations on increasing clinical prevention opportunities, reducing health disparities, managing/preventing chronic disease, and creating community linkages to support health promotion. We strive to transform the quality of health care services by helping providers use electronic health records (EHRs) and transform clinical workflows to improve the quality of care. The Hub Data Analyst will be responsible for producing and analyzing clinical data derived from electronic health records. These data are from health care settings and are pre-aggregated to create reports and data sets to assess the quality of care and preventive service utilization in primary care settings. In addition, reports are created from this unique data source to support PCIP's quality improvement programs, to track and explain trends, and to relay the results of this data to other DOHMH programs for use in resource allocation, program evaluation, policy, and planning. The Analyst will work with a dynamic, cross-disciplinary team that extracts data from the Hub Population Health System (the Hub), a cutting-edge, real-time query system which gathers aggregate data from EHRs at more than 700 doctor's offices, community health centers, and hospital clinics. The Hub covers 2 million patients per year in NYC and allows the DOHMH to answer relevant public health questions in a timely manner.\n<br><br>\n<strong>DUTIES WILL INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO:</strong>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>-Collect, clean, analyze and report on data derived from clinical systems to produce reports, presentations, papers and other tabular and graphical summaries of findings for dissemination internally and externally to support the evaluation of PCIP's programs, and to explore topics relevant to PCIP and DOH priorities, such as chronic disease and quality of care.</li>\n<li>-Assist with quality assurance processes and query writing for the Hub, using SQL logic in conjunction with working knowledge of EHR data structure and clinical workflows.</li>\n<li>-Partner with other DOHMH bureaus to develop joint projects that analyze Hub data to support and promote primary care.</li>\n<li>-Rapidly respond to requests for data from the Bureau, Division and Agency leadership.</li>\n<li>-Assist with and conduct analyses on an ad hoc basis as requests come in from different PCIP teams.</li>\n<li>-Present on evaluation and Hub activities (i.e., internal staff meetings; agency workgroups etc.).</li>\n<li>-Contribute to the writing of manuscripts, white papers or other summaries of research and program evaluation findings; pursue personal research interests aligning with PCIP and Hub team goals.</li></ul></div> \n\n\n<div> Minimum Qual Requirements</div><br>\n\n<div> 1.
