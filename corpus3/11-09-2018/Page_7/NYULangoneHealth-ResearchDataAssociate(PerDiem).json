The complications of cardiac arrest include brain injury, disorders of consciousness and neurocognitive deficits. However, it is increasingly recognized that a systematic approach to cardiac arrest and post-resuscitation care can significantly improve survival, neurological and neurocognitive outcomes. This knowledge, combined with the significant social and medical impact of this condition on human lives, has led to the development of a clinical and research program towards combatting this condition.<br> Following the advent of modern cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest (CA), millions of people have survived CA, and many people have provided anecdotal reports of lucid well-structured thought processes with memory formation from a period during CA, including so called near death experiences. In recent years, the accuracy of these reports, have been further supported by evidence from case studies, and more recently large scale prospective CA studies. The occurrence of consciousness at the time CA is highly significant, as data from independent studies indicate that brain function ceases during CA. We are one of the few centers with an established track record of research into real-time non-invasive monitoring of brain resuscitation during CA, as well as the study of consciousness/awareness and the cognitive and mental experience of CA.</p><p><br> This multi-centered, prospective and retrospective study investigates the detailed cognitive recollections of cardiac arrest survivors using a mixed methods approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative research. This study aims to understand conscious awareness and/or mental cognitive states during cardiac arrest/circulatory standstill while examining their relationship with markers of brain resuscitation. Furthermore, we plan to establish themes that relate to the experience of cardiac arrest and their impact on neuropsychological outcomes and quality of life.</p><p><strong>Job Responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>collaborate with the Resuscitation Research team in attending cardiac arrest events where real-time brain monitoring data is collected.
