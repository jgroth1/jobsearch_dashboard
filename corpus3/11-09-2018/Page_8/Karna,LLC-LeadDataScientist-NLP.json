The Ambulatory and Hospital Care Statistics Branch conducts nationally representative surveys of hospital inpatient, emergency, and outpatient departments; ambulatory surgery centers; and office-based physicians. These surveys collect data about clinicians and organizations, and their patients, and about management of patients\u2019 conditions. Policymakers and researchers use these data to analyze patterns in management of specific conditions, quality of care and disparities among populations, and the effects of policy change. The NLP SME will be a member of the Dissemination Team, which is responsible for disseminating information by creating public use files (PUFs) and publishing government reports and other publications. The NLP SME will provide expert technical assistance and guidance regarding the development, refinement, application and functionality requirements for the NLP-based algorithm. Other responsibilities include:\n<ul>\n<li>Investigate and recommend the best NLP programming platform or package. Considerations when recommending the NLP platform or package should include whether the package or platform is currently supported by CDC infrastructure, whether it is widely used and accepted in the field, and whether it can continue to be used by NCHS staff after the project is completed.</li><li>Provide expert technical assistance and guidance regarding the development, refinement, application and functionality requirements for the NLP-based algorithm.</li><li>Provide input to NCHS project staff and the opioid project\u2019s research analyst (\u2018research analyst\u2019) on any known or identified NLP algorithms, NLP methods, NLP tools and activities that are in use by federal agencies, public health agencies, academic centers, and commercial vendors, and are programs that are available through the CDC.</li><li>Contribute to the following reports[1] as:</li></ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Supporting author on a brief internal memo summarizing efforts to update the existing medical code-based algorithm and apply it to NHCS data to produce counts of opioid-involved visits</li><li>Supporting author on a brief internal memo summarizing efforts to apply the updated DMI program to NHCS data to produce counts of opioid-involved visits</li><li>Lead author on a draft and final plan for building a new NLP algorithm to identify opioid-involved visits using NHCS clinical provider notes. The final plan should incorporate findings from a review of existing NLP and text mining methods for identifying visits involving specific types of opioids. In addition, the final plan provide a sufficient level of detail to guide the Research Analyst in the use of the selected NLP software/platform in building and implementing the algorithm.
