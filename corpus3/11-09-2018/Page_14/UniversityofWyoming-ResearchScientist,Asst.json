{"job title": "Research Scientist, Asst", "company": "University of Wyoming", "city state": "\u2013 Laramie, WY", "rating": "4.0", "job description": "<div> <div>Please Note</div>\n</div> <div> <div><div><strong>Laboratory Technician\n<br>\n<u>WILDLIFE GENOMICS, POPULATION GENETICS, and DISEASE ECOLOGY</u></strong>\n<br><br>\nA laboratory technician position is available to assist research in wildlife population genetics &amp; genomics. The position will be primarily lab-based within the Ernest Wildlife Genomics and Disease Ecology Laboratory in the Department of Veterinary Sciences which has affiliations with the University of Wyoming (UW) Graduate Program in Ecology.\n<br><br>\n<strong>*Apply as soon as possible, applications will be reviewed as they are received. See instructions below*</strong>\n<br><br>\nThe technician will be responsible for lab work, including assisting other lab members with research and responsibilities may include supervising and mentoring undergraduate students. Lab work may involve genomic (next gen sequence data generation and analysis) and genetic (microsatellite) to examine landscape-level genetic diversity, population structure, and population health/disease of wildlife species in the Rocky Mountain West and California. Projects will involve species of current focus in our lab (see our website). Work will involve processing samples, entering data into electronic data bases, maintaining lab safety procedures, equipment and reagents, and more. This position will contribute to graduate students\u2019 and lab\u2019s research on genomics and population health of pronghorn, mule deer, hummingbird, sea otter, black bear, and/or other species, as well as aspects of wildlife population health and/or disease ecology. Responsibilities may also include contributing to data analysis, manuscript writing for peer-reviewed publication, grant-writing, and development of oral and poster presentations of research. Desire to assist in lab management is a plus.\n<br><br>\nThe Ernest Wildlife Genomics and Disease Ecology Laboratory is a dynamic and highly collaborative lab at UW. We work with other academic institutions, as well as state, federal, and non-governmental agencies toward wildlife conservation and management. There are many opportunities to work with recognized leaders who apply excellence in science toward wildlife conservation and management. Quality mentorship of trainees of all educational levels is a priority for the laboratory. University of Wyoming hosts excellent wildlife and ecology science and a collegial academic atmosphere. Laramie is a wonderful college town of ~ 30,000 and offers easy access to the Rocky Mountains and outdoor activities including skiing, hiking, climbing, birding, and fishing &amp; hunting.\n<br><br>\nThe work requires the ability to read and interpret very small print and subtle visual differences such as in data readouts, lifting of objects up to 30 pounds, potentially having rabies vaccination series (if needed for work with samples from carnivores and bats), and occasional field work involving hiking and work in potentially harsh outdoors environments (see below, under requirements) with or without a reasonable accommodation.\n<br><br>\n<strong><em>The University of Wyoming invites diverse applicants to consider our employment opportunities.
