Responsibilities include performing PK (GLP and non-GLP) analyses, PK/PD analyses, and predictive PK and TK modeling using appropriate recent software, e.g. Phoenix WinNonlin, and scientific interpretation of PK/TK data and writing study reports for submission to the FDA. The candidate may also assume the role of a Study Director to conduct non-GLP and GLP studies supported by NIH and other government funds and commercial sources, which will include planning and management of all aspects of in vivo studies including preparation of study protocols and coordination with other groups (such as Bioanalytical Chemistry, Formulation, and Toxicology). The studies will include compounds of various therapeutic classes (e.g. neurotherapeutics, anti-cancer, anti-infective). The scientist will participate or assume lead authorship in resulting manuscripts from these studies and present abstracts in meetings/conferences. Opportunities also exist within our group to pursue independent research interests in the form of grants and contracts, as well as working closely with other research scientists/mentors in the areas of drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics and toxicology.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Auto req ID</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>1616BR</strong>\n<br><br>\n<strong>Location(s)</strong>\n<br>\nMenlo Park, CA\n<br><br>\n<strong>Other Requirements</strong>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>-A post-offer, pre-laboratory placement physical examination may be required.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>Employment Status</strong>\n<br>\nFull Time\n<br><br>\n<strong>Qualifications</strong>\n<br>\nPh.D. degree in Pharmacokinetics, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Pharmacology, Toxicology or related discipline with 1 \u2013 3 years of post-doctoral experience in academia or industry.
